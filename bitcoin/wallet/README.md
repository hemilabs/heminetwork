# wallet

Wallet is a collection of convenience structures, functions and interfaces that
can be tied together to create a bitcoin wallet. All wallets have slightly
different requirements and these packages try to break a wallet down into its
constituent components.

The components are:
* gozer - Interface to a bitcoin source of truth.
* vinzclortho - Package that handles creation and derivation bitcoin addresses.
* zuul - Package that handles storage of secret material. 

## Canon

Gozer was originally worshiped as a god by the Hittites, Mesopotamians, and the
Sumerians around 6000 BC. Gozer was genderless and could assume any form it
wanted. Gozer had two trusted minions – themselves worshiped as demigods – that
were harbingers of destruction and primary agents for its arrival: Vinz
Clortho, The Keymaster and Zuul, The Gatekeeper. The Sumerians believed in a
land of the dead, a dark and shadowy realm within the bowels of the earth where
the souls of the dead were ruled by Gozer and protected by the Gatekeeper and
Keymaster. Gozer also consumed the souls of those sacrificed to it. In order
for Gozer to rise up and walk the human plane again, the Gatekeeper and
Keymaster had to assume the form of beasts. During the rectification of
the Vuldronaii, Gozer came as a large moving Torb. Then, during the third
reconciliation of the last of the Meketrex Supplicants, they chose the form of
a giant Sloar.
