Hemi is an EVM-compatible L2 blockchain that combines the security of Bitcoin with the programmability of Ethereum.

This repository contains the core daemons of the Hemi Network, including:

- **bfgd**: Hemi Bitcoin Finality Governor daemon.
- **hproxyd**: A proxy for balancing RPC requests across Hemi nodes.
- **popmd**: The Hemi PoP Miner daemon.
- **tbcd**: A fully custom, embeddable Bitcoin node written in Go.
