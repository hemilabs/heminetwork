## What is the Hemi Network?

Hemi is an EVM compatible L2 blockchain that brings Bitcoin security and Ethereum programability together.

### Services

Hemi Network consists of 3 services:

* [PoP Miner (popmd)](service/popm): "mines" L2 Keystones into BTC blocks for proof-of-proof
* [Bitcoin Finality Governor (bfgd)](service/bfg): Hemi's gateway to the BTC network.
* [Bitcoin Secure Sequencer (bssd)](service/bss): Optimism's gateway to BFG, manages Hemi Network's consensus

## Getting Started

### Building from Source

To build, you must have the following installed:

* `git`
* `make`
* `go 1.21+`

First, clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hemilabs/heminetwork.git
```

Then build:

```shell
make
```

This will put built binaries in `<path-to-repo>/bin/`

### Downloading Binaries from Releases

You can find releases on the [Releases Page](https://github.com/hemilabs/heminetwork/releases)

### Running

To view options for any of the services, you may run the following

```shell
./bin/popmd --help
```

```shell
./bin/bfgd --help
```

```shell
./bin/bssd --help
```

### Running popmd

popmd has a few crucial requirements to run:

* a BTC private key that is funded, this can be a testnet address if you configure popmd as such
* a BFG URL to connect to

if configured correctly and running, then popmd will start "mining" L2 Keystones by adding them to btc blocks that make
it into the chain

#### CLI

```shell
./bin/popmd
```

#### Web

```shell
cd ./web
make
go run ./integrationtest
```

### Running bfgd

bfgd has a few crucial requirements to run:

* a postgres database, bfgd expects the sql scripts in `./database/bfgd/scripts/` to be run to set up your schema
* an electrumx node connected to the proper bitcoin network (testnet vs mainnet, etc.)

### Running bssd

bssd has a few crucial requirements to run:

* a bfgd instance running to connect to

### Running Network

Prerequisites: `docker`

To run the full network locally, you can run the following.  Note that this will create
L2Keytones and BTC Blocks at a high rate.  

You can modify these via the env variables:
* `HEMI_LOCAL_BTC_RATE_SECONDS`: generate new BTC Block at this rate of seconds
* `HEMI_LOCAL_L2K_RATE_SECONDS`: generate new L2 Keystone at this rate of seconds

note: the `--build` flag is optional if you want to rebuild your code

```
docker-compose -f ./e2e/docker-compose.yml up --build
```



### Running the full network tests

This runs a test with an entirely local heminet, it uses bitcoind in regtest
mode for the bitcoin chain

Prerequisites: `docker`

```
make networktest
```
